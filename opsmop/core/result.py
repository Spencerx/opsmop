        A result can be constructed with many parameters, most of which have reasonable defaults:

        provider - a reference to the provider object (required)
        resource - a reference to the resource the provider is executing (required)
        rc - the return code of any CLI command
        data - the output of a CLI command, or any structured data for use with 'register'
        fatal - a flag that indicates the result should probably end the program, but it is up to the callback code
        primary - indicates that the result is the final return of a module, as opposed to an intermediate command result
        reason - if set, the lookup used in evaluating the failure status of the result (for failed_when, etc).

        actions - what actions were run?
